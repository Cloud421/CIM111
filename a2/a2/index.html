      <h1>Sky Legrand <br>sxl1201@miami.edu <br> (305)-904-4626</h1>


      <p>Born in Miami Florida, I grew up with one younger brother, a French father, and an American mother.
       <br>
       I am a Marketing major at the University of Miami. My passions include drawing / kite surfing, and
       <br>
       cars. Throughout my life, I have traveled to many places and hope to one day study abroad in Japan.
       <br>
       My all time goal is to be a very successful entreprenuer and master the ways of marketing and
       selling.</p>
