                <h1> Itachi Uchiha </h1>
                        <p> Itachi Uchiha comes from the very famous Anime 'Naruto Shippuden' where he is an older brother to an already very powerful Sasuke Uchiha who is one of the main characters. Sasuke and Itachi were the last two members remaining of the Uchiha Clan which gives their eyes special abilities making them extremely agile, able to peer seconds into the future, and set things ablaze just by looking at it. Itachi was known as a rogue ninja and was killed early into the show because he couldn't bring himself to kill his little brother, but his outrageous potential to defeat anybody that stands in his way is very well known. </p>

                  <h1> Akame </h1>
                          <p> Akame comes from a not so popular, but very well made Anime called Akame Ga Kill. Even though her name is in the title of the show, she is not the main character. Don't let her innocent looks fool you for she is a master at weilding her Cursed Katana. One tiny open wound cause by her sword means instant death for any unlucky soul. Althought she isn't the main character, she ends up being the only character that survives in the end.

                  <h1> Monkey D. Luffy </h1>
                        <P> Luffy comes from one of the most popular shows still to this day, 'One Piece' which is based around Pirates vs. The Government / Navy. The show is still producing episodes every sunday, so Luffy has not reached his full potential in the show but it is known in the end that he becomes the one and only Pirate King. His power comes from a Devil Fruit which is a very rare fruit that when eaten, gives a wide variety of powers, and for Luffy, he is a man made of rubber. It doesn't sound like the strongest power in the world, but because he has trained every day for so many years he has turned it into one of the hardest hitting powers in his world.

                <h1> Shoto Todoroki </h1>
                      <p> Todoroki comes from a pretty new Anime called 'My Hero Academia' where he plays one of two rivals that rival the main character. In this world, every person at the age of 7 inherits their parent's super power or a mixture of both. Todoroki's father, who is a god of fire and the #2 hero in the world, and Todoroki's mother, who can control ice, gave birth to him giving half of his body the power of fire and the other half, the power of ice making him a VERY strong individual. The limits of his powers are still unknown but he is seen in the show as a very promising and upcoming super hero just by the sheer ability he has shown in many major events.
